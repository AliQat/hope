### INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN

1. Open the .zip file or extract it if you would like
2. Make sure index.html, main.js and styles.css are in the same folder
3. Open index and you can play with the Dice Module Prototype

### NOTES
**THE PROGRAM CAN BE RUN ON ELECTRON!!**
do not write code in main.js, it is only meant for rendering. Maybe we will write code there in the future but not for this module.
I will get the Event creator prototype finsihed with by Sunday noon and GUI prototype is set to be made on saturday later on

### BRIEF
1. The program has a tab (or button if you wanna call it that) at the bottom left of the screen
2. Clicking the button allows the user to see the denomination of dice to roll
3. The user can click on these dice denominations and the chosen dice will be added to a buffer. This buffer holds all the dice that will be rolled
4. When the user is satisfied with the amount of dice to be rolled, they can press a button that says "roll" at the bottom left of the screen beneath the options of the denominations.
5. The previous result is the only one that is stored for now, I can add a buffer that will contain all the results since the start of the application window which may be helpful for players.

P.S. **Stored** means that the user can see the result even after they have close the dice tab and thus hiding the options and the result value which is displayed in the top left of the screen
